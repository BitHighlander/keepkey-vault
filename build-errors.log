 ⚠ Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of /Users/highlander/pnpm-lock.yaml as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `turbopack.root` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#root-directory for more information.
 Detected additional lockfiles: 
   * /Users/highlander/WebstormProjects/keepkey-stack/projects/keepkey-vault/pnpm-lock.yaml
   * /Users/highlander/WebstormProjects/keepkey-stack/pnpm-lock.yaml

List all export names manually (`export { a, b, c } from "...") or rewrite the module to ESM, to avoid the additional runtime code.`
